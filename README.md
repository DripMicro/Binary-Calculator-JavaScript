# Binary-Calculator-JavaScript

A Calculator for binary operations

Feel free to use the Calculator for teaching Numeral systems as an example.
If you have Suggestions or find Errors, you're free to contact me on GitHub.
The Reason why I build this Calculator was, because there wasn't a good one in the Web.
The next Project will be a ternary Calculator for ternary calculations with trytes and trits,
this will be a perfect template to create such one.

## Binary-Operations

- + (Addition)
- - (Subtraction)
- * (Multiplication)
- / (Division)

- ! (NOT) ex. ! 10101010 = 01010101
- << (Bitwise Left Shift) ex. 1010 << 0101
- >> (Bitwise Right Shift) ex. 1010 >> 0101

- AND / NAND
- OR / NOR
- XOR / XNOR

## As efficient as possible

The Calculator is designed to give responses on every action,
this is noticeable as an example at the addition of two Bytes,
while you're typing an algorithm already calculates every number you type.

## The Future

- Implementing a switch that allows you to change between Signed and Unsigned (negative numbers possible, ex. unsigned 16-Bit Integer).
- Using BigNumber.js, this is needed to display 64-Bit, 128-Bit , 256-Bit, ... (JavaScript has no datatypes, var is being saved as an signed 32-Bit Integer +- 2 147 483 647)
- Implementing a Ternary Calculator that is working with Trits and Trytes, this is very interesting for quantum mechanics (Quantum Computing)
,a good way of a concept that could be used to use the power of Qubits that can have multiple states.
